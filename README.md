# My DSA Learning Journey

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey! This repository serves as a log of my commitment to mastering DSA concepts and improving my problem-solving skills.

## About the Journey
- Start Date: December 19, 2024
- Resource Used: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&si=wJOIT072otN4DqFz
- Purpose:
  - Build a solid foundation in DSA.
  - Prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming.
  - Enhance my coding skills to contribute to open-source projects and participate in GSoC 2025.

## Goals
1. Learn and implement core DSA topics such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming.
2. Solve problems regularly on LeetCode.
3. Document my learning process and key takeaways to track progress and help others.

## Why GitHub?
I chose GitHub as a platform to document my journey because:
- It provides a centralized location for my notes and code implementations.
- It allows me to showcase my progress and dedication to potential mentors and collaborators.
- It encourages consistency and accountability.
